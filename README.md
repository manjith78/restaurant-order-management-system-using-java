Overview
The application is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows both managers and customers to interact with a restaurant order management system. It connects to a PostgreSQL database to handle menu items and orders.

Code Structure
Main Class (finalresdb):

This class extends JFrame and serves as the main entry point of the application.
It sets up the main window with buttons for "Manager Mode" and "Customer Mode."
Database Connection Parameters:

URL, USER, PASSWORD, and MANAGER_PASSWORD: These are constants that define the connection parameters for the PostgreSQL database and the manager's password for accessing the manager panel.
Constructor (finalresdb):

Initializes the main frame, sets its title and size, and creates two buttons for navigating to the manager and customer panels.
Action Listeners:

Manager Button: Opens the ManagerPanel after validating the manager's password.
Customer Button: Opens the CustomerPanel for customer interactions.
Manager Panel (ManagerPanel class):

This class extends JFrame and includes functionality specific to the manager's role.
It contains buttons for various operations: viewing the menu, adding, updating, deleting menu items, viewing orders, and updating order status.
Database Operations:

Customer Panel (CustomerPanel class):

This class also extends JFrame and focuses on customer interactions.
It provides buttons to view the menu, place orders, and view the customer's own orders.
Customer Operations:

View Menu: Similar to the managerâ€™s function, it retrieves menu items from the Menu table.
Place Order: Prompts the customer for table number, order type, menu ID, and quantity, then inserts the order into the Orders table.
View My Orders: Retrieves and displays orders placed by the customer based on their table number.
Database Structure
Menu Table: Contains details of menu items (menu_id, item_name, price, quantity).
Orders Table: Stores orders with details such as order_id, menu_id, quantity, order_type, table_number, order_time, and order_status.
Exception Handling
The application includes basic error handling using try-catch blocks to manage SQL exceptions, providing feedback via dialog boxes if errors occur during database operations.
Summary
This application provides a functional framework for managing restaurant orders, enabling efficient interaction between customers and managers while maintaining data integrity in the database. You can expand its features further, such as adding more sophisticated user management, better error handling, and improved UI design.
